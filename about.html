            <h2>Our Story</h2>

            <p class = "story">Our company was founded 3 years ago. Our group first began making games in college for our game development class. We didn't all know each other at the time, but 
                soon it became apparent that this group was capable of making great games together! Our first game, Slug Jumper, was such a big hit that we decided to continue 
                as a company beyond the classroom. Since then, we have gone on to make best selling games such as "Enter the Crypt", and are planning on making many more games in the future!

            <h2>Our Goals</h2>

            <p class = "story">As a game development company, our goal is to release the best quality games we can. Our team is made up of like-minded, motivated individuals who are passionate about
                gaming. We ensure that all of our products are made with care. It's important to us that we make games that we ourselves would want to play! Our motto is to never release anything we are not
                proud of. If we as game developers don't think our product is up to our standards, we won't release anything.
