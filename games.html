            <h2>Embark on the Journey of a Lifetime</h2>

            <p style = "position: relative; width: 400px;">You are the Slug Boy, a slug who has aspirations for great adventure. You will embark on a journey across the bug kingdom in order
                to achieve your potential. Tired of being told you're nothing but a lowly slug, you will travel across the great backyard to the tree.
                A mystical beacon that all bugs and backyard life aspire to reach. At the top holds untold power, something that you as the Slug Boy wish to reach.
            </p>

            <h2>Run and Jump Across many Obstacles</h2>

            <p style = "position: relative; width: 400px;">The journey won't be easy, for it is a treacherous path to reach the tree. You will have to endure many hardships, avoid salt, jump over spikes, and outmaneuver your enemies.
                You are no fighter, but that doesn't mean you don't have a few tricks up your sleeve! As the Slug Boy, you have an inherent ability to jump, climb, and run great distances to avoid
                your foes. But be careful, for there are stories of a great beast lurking around the base of the tree, ready to take on any foolish enough to aproach it...

            <h2>Use Strategy to Outwit your Foes</h2>

            <p style = "position: relative; width: 400px;">At your disposal is the best technology your kingdom has to offer. Place towers across the map to stop the invading forces from reaching your 
                castle. Place them in spots where they won't be able to proceed. Choose from a variety of different tower types to mow down the enemy. From a tower that locks on to the enemy to one that slows them
                down, there are a number of towers for you to choose from! But be warned, there have been tales that the army of the underworld have their own tricks up their sleevees...
